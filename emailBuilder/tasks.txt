rewrite image assigner function so it fires on name image and not column select

1. Add an automated description of content of table; i.e. 1 col 1 image, 3 col, 1 text area

save column text content within an object so that if the user switches back to a column that already contains text it writes that back to the textfield so 
they can continue to edit that textfield
best way of doing this would be an object

idea 1
table {

    column1: "text"
    column2: "image"
    column3: "blank"


}

idea 2
table {

    column1: ["text", "This would be the text that has been written"]
    column2: ["image", "images/image-1.img"]
    column3: ["blank", "&amp;nbsp;"]


}

idea 2 would be better because i can run the conditionals based on the first value and then write the second value to the textareas
it would also work with image and i can define what a blank field is


columns = [["column1", "text","this is the text"],["column2", "img","images/image-1"]]

idea3 store the values in a multi tierd array, this is the best solution, most prctical to impliment, as i wouldnt have to create a bunch of empty column objects on the initial table prototype


table.column1() === typeof(String) ? write to textfield : break


if table and column is selected in the select field run an if statement to see if there is a previous value
if yes, write the content to the textfield
if not break

when text is added to a column it needs to be stored within its corresponsiding table object



2. Redesign the front end to be easier to navigate and reorder to the layout to follow a more logical flow

BUGS

---- Need to fix this ----
adding and removing table columns leaves the whitespace from the template behind
